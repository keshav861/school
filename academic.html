               <h2>Teaching Methodology</h2>
               <p>
                  <i>Our teaching methods are designed to fulfill these future needs. Our teachers will employ a variety
                     of
                     teaching strategies in the classroom and would be trained to listen to the voice of the learner and
                     bring out the best in each child. They will also actively engage them in interactions. This will be
                     achieved through group work and whole-class instruction, which can be very active if it involves
                     open
                     discussion and learners responding and presenting rather than the teacher constantly lecturing.
                     This
                     process helps to develop independent learners as they start to model themselves along the teacher’s
                     approach. Our educators will challenge the learners’ thinking and support them to learn and finally
                     accomplish tasks independently. Our teaching methods will facilitate students to become independent
                     and collaborative critical thinkers.</i>
